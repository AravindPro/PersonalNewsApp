The exhibit, titled Bangalore Then and Now, serves as an extension of Paul\u2019s book. \u2018 Bangalore Then and Now \u2018is an exhibition of Drawings and Illustrations by Paul Fernandes at Bangalore International Centre. | Photo Credit: BHAGYA PRAKASH K / THE HINDU Past and present The exhibition and book take one on a journey through swathes of time, with glimpses of the city\u2019s past, present, and possible future. Starting from the story of Bengaluru\u2019s founding when it was under the governance of a Chieftain of the Yelahanka Prabhus, it is a journey through the city\u2019s many avatars \u2013 from a sleepy pensioner\u2019s paradise and garden city to a cosmopolitan wonderland of snazzy pubs with draft beer on tap, and through the \u2018IT boom\u2019, which made Bengaluru the poster child of successful globalisation. The exhibition also shows how Bengaluru became India\u2019s fastest-growing city, expanding chaotically in all ways and directions; for better or for worse, followed by the takeover by a virulent virus \u2013 COVID-19. Speaking to The Hindu, Paul says that the COVID-19 pandemic was part of the morphing of Bengaluru, and easily got included in the book, \u201cIt started off with trying to record the change we saw in Bengaluru, through drawings. We came to the understanding that the book was complete, and suddenly we were plunged into the world of COVID-19. That\u2019s when I started drawing about what was happening around us, and Chicku started writing about it. And we suddenly realised that it was a continuation of the morphing of Bengaluru, so it got included well in the book\u201d. Extended projectPaul says there was never a deadline to finish the book, but it took him close to six years to complete it, \u201cThere is never a time period you can specify when you are creating art. I remember Chicku would call me and say, \u2018do you think we could be ready by December?\u2018 And all I would ask \u2018Which December?\u2018. So, it is a long project that can not have a deadline until you have understood what you are hoping to achieve from it. It has taken 5-6 years at least.\u201cPeppered with interesting facts from now and then, The Great Bangalore Morph chronicles the historical, geographical, social, economic and cultural growth of the city. To make it easy to navigate, the authors break Bengaluru\u2019s history into three distinct periods: Days of Yore, More Familiar Times, and 2019: The Year Our World Changed. \u201cIn Days of Yore we look at a very colourful, long and eventful history of the city in the thousand-plus years before independence. In the middle section we look at glimpses of life as the city morphed, pretty much as we have seen it. There are images of the first electricity pole that came to Asia in Bengaluru and what happened to it through time. And the final section is 2019: The Year Our World Changed, the period in which COVID-19 hit Bengaluru and the rest of the world,\u201d he says.For the youngPaul\u2019s idea was to provide a very simple idea of Bengaluru\u2019s morphing over time, and not make it too heavy a book to read. \u201cThe book uses mild humour to sometimes look at a difficult subject. My interest is to take this book to young people in a very simple and entertaining manner and not ask them to read deeply, because these days people do not have time to read deeply,\u201c Paul added.Working with Chicku Jayadeva was rewarding, says Paul. \u201cShe is able to take a very raw thought, and really give it all the time and strength it needs to become a full thought. It is wonderful working with her, she gives it all the research and information the idea wants before it becomes ready to draw. That is her skill,\u201d he says.The book The Great Bangalore Morph: From Kempegowda to Covid is priced at \u20b91,800 and is available on apaulogy.com and at the aPaulogy Gallery in Richards Town. The book is also available for sale at the exhibition in BIC, Domlur. The exhibition is on till December 13.

Starting from the story of Bengaluru\u2019s founding when it was under the governance of a Chieftain of the Yelahanka Prabhus, it is a journey through the city\u2019s many avatars \u2013 from a sleepy pensioner\u2019s paradise and garden city to a cosmopolitan wonderland of snazzy pubs with draft beer on tap, and through the \u2018IT boom\u2019, which made Bengaluru the poster child of successful globalisation. The exhibition also shows how Bengaluru became India\u2019s fastest-growing city, expanding chaotically in all ways and directions; for better or for worse, followed by the takeover by a virulent virus \u2013 COVID-19. Speaking to The Hindu, Paul says that the COVID-19 pandemic was part of the morphing of Bengaluru, and easily got included in the book, \u201cIt started off with trying to record the change we saw in Bengaluru, through drawings. We came to the understanding that the book was complete, and suddenly we were plunged into the world of COVID-19. That\u2019s when I started drawing about what was happening around us, and Chicku started writing about it. And we suddenly realised that it was a continuation of the morphing of Bengaluru, so it got included well in the book\u201d. Extended projectPaul says there was never a deadline to finish the book, but it took him close to six years to complete it, \u201cThere is never a time period you can specify when you are creating art. I remember Chicku would call me and say, \u2018do you think we could be ready by December?\u2018 And all I would ask \u2018Which December?\u2018. So, it is a long project that can not have a deadline until you have understood what you are hoping to achieve from it. It has taken 5-6 years at least.\u201cPeppered with interesting facts from now and then, The Great Bangalore Morph chronicles the historical, geographical, social, economic and cultural growth of the city. To make it easy to navigate, the authors break Bengaluru\u2019s history into three distinct periods: Days of Yore, More Familiar Times, and 2019: The Year Our World Changed. \u201cIn Days of Yore we look at a very colourful, long and eventful history of the city in the thousand-plus years before independence. In the middle section we look at glimpses of life as the city morphed, pretty much as we have seen it. There are images of the first electricity pole that came to Asia in Bengaluru and what happened to it through time. And the final section is 2019: The Year Our World Changed, the period in which COVID-19 hit Bengaluru and the rest of the world,\u201d he says.For the youngPaul\u2019s idea was to provide a very simple idea of Bengaluru\u2019s morphing over time, and not make it too heavy a book to read. \u201cThe book uses mild humour to sometimes look at a difficult subject. My interest is to take this book to young people in a very simple and entertaining manner and not ask them to read deeply, because these days people do not have time to read deeply,\u201c Paul added.Working with Chicku Jayadeva was rewarding, says Paul. \u201cShe is able to take a very raw thought, and really give it all the time and strength it needs to become a full thought. It is wonderful working with her, she gives it all the research and information the idea wants before it becomes ready to draw. That is her skill,\u201d he says.The book The Great Bangalore Morph: From Kempegowda to Covid is priced at \u20b91,800 and is available on apaulogy.com and at the aPaulogy Gallery in Richards Town. The book is also available for sale at the exhibition in BIC, Domlur. The exhibition is on till December 13.

Representational file image | Photo Credit: B. VELANKANNI RAJ 361 railway workers have died in the past five years while on duty, due to train accidents during maintenance work on railway tracks, data tabled in Rajya Sabha by Ministry of Railways states. The largest number of deaths, up to 44 occurred in the Central Railway, followed by 40 deaths in the Northern Railway and 31 deaths in the North Central Railway. East Central Railway has recorded 30 deaths followed by 24 deaths each in South East Central Railway, and North Western Railway. Southern Railway has recorded 20 deaths. West Central Railway, Western Railway and East Coast Railway have recorded 19 deaths each. Also, Eastern Railway recorded 23 deaths, South Central Railway (18), Northeast Frontier Railway (16), South Eastern Railway (15), North Eastern Railway (13), South Western Railway (6). Low sound, increased speed and curves on tracks make the tracks men and key men particularly vulnerable to getting knocked down by speeding trains. The Indian Railways has sanctioned up to \u20b991.61 crores for 12 zonal railways for the provision of a Very High Frequency (VHF) based Approaching Train Warning System (RAKSHAK) for track maintainers. RAKSHAK is a walkie talkie-like equipment, which can alert the workers on track in advance about approaching trains. In the reply, Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that the RAKSHAK system is not effective in hilly terrain, deep cuttings, tunnels and sharp curves, where there is obstruction in the line of sight. \u201cThe system does not work fully in Automatic Block Signalling Territory where number of trains ply in single block section at close interval and signals are placed 1 km apart. Also the system does not function on sections with more than two lines,\u201d the reply stated. \u201cConsidering the above limitations of RAKSHAK system, it has not yet been provided on 55 divisions of Indian Railways,\u201d said the reply. Deaths have occurred despite personal protective equipment like luminous vests, safety helmets, miner lights, try-colour torches, safety shoes, retro-reflective, high visibility jackets and light weight improved tools and equipment given to track maintainers. Mr. Vaishnaw said in the reply that the work site remote control hooter and whistle have been provided to all gangs to warn the working personnel about the approaching train. \u201cLookout men are also deputed where necessary to watch for the approaching train,\u201d the reply states.

Representational file image | Photo Credit: B. VELANKANNI RAJ 361 railway workers have died in the past five years while on duty, due to train accidents during maintenance work on railway tracks, data tabled in Rajya Sabha by Ministry of Railways states. The largest number of deaths, up to 44 occurred in the Central Railway, followed by 40 deaths in the Northern Railway and 31 deaths in the North Central Railway. East Central Railway has recorded 30 deaths followed by 24 deaths each in South East Central Railway, and North Western Railway. Southern Railway has recorded 20 deaths. West Central Railway, Western Railway and East Coast Railway have recorded 19 deaths each. Also, Eastern Railway recorded 23 deaths, South Central Railway (18), Northeast Frontier Railway (16), South Eastern Railway (15), North Eastern Railway (13), South Western Railway (6). Low sound, increased speed and curves on tracks make the tracks men and key men particularly vulnerable to getting knocked down by speeding trains. The Indian Railways has sanctioned up to \u20b991.61 crores for 12 zonal railways for the provision of a Very High Frequency (VHF) based Approaching Train Warning System (RAKSHAK) for track maintainers. RAKSHAK is a walkie talkie-like equipment, which can alert the workers on track in advance about approaching trains. In the reply, Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that the RAKSHAK system is not effective in hilly terrain, deep cuttings, tunnels and sharp curves, where there is obstruction in the line of sight. \u201cThe system does not work fully in Automatic Block Signalling Territory where number of trains ply in single block section at close interval and signals are placed 1 km apart. Also the system does not function on sections with more than two lines,\u201d the reply stated. \u201cConsidering the above limitations of RAKSHAK system, it has not yet been provided on 55 divisions of Indian Railways,\u201d said the reply. Deaths have occurred despite personal protective equipment like luminous vests, safety helmets, miner lights, try-colour torches, safety shoes, retro-reflective, high visibility jackets and light weight improved tools and equipment given to track maintainers. Mr. Vaishnaw said in the reply that the work site remote control hooter and whistle have been provided to all gangs to warn the working personnel about the approaching train. \u201cLookout men are also deputed where necessary to watch for the approaching train,\u201d the reply states.

Rajeev COMMents SHARE Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL The State government has decided to raise market borrowings of \u20b9500 crore. It has put up an indent for raising the amount through auction of securities to be conducted by the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday. The development assumes significance as the State is inching closer to the limit on borrowings imposed by the Union Finance Ministry. The Union Ministry, in response to a query, said that the borrowing limit of the State for 2023-24 was set at \u20b957,813.99 crore. However, as the State government had over-borrowed in the preceding financial years, the gross borrowing limit of the State had been fixed at \u20b942,225 crore after adjusting over borrowing of \u20b915,588 crore of previous years. Of the limit set by the Union Finance Ministry, the State had opted for negotiated loans of \u20b91,500 crore and estimated borrowing from the public account was \u20b94,107 crore, leaving a space for mobilising the remaining \u20b936,617 crore from the open market.The Ministry said the limit had been arrived as per the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission as well as the guidelines for annual borrowing ceiling. Given this background, the State had already mobilised \u20b933,378 crore till October end, according to the provisional information released by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. In addition, it went for open market borrowings of another \u20b93,000 crore in the auction of securities conducted by the RBI during November taking the total to \u20b936,378 crore.This means that the State can borrow around \u20b9300 crore for the remaining part of the financial year, but the State had submitted an indent for \u20b9500 crore.

Revanth Reddy took oath as the Chief Minister of Telangana, but he is yet to get his full team of officials in the Chief Minister\u2019s Office.There are reports that senior IAS officer V. Seshadri has been appointed as the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, but orders to this effect are yet to be issued. Mr. Seshadri is, however, attending all the review meetings that are being conducted by the new Chief Minister.The CMO, which is considered a mini-Secretariat in itself needs at at least one Principal Secretary and three Secretary-level officials to handle the day-to-day affairs of the Chief Minister. Other than Mr. Seshadri, the CMO is nearly empty barring full-timers Smitha Sabharwal and Priyanka Verghese continuing in their posts as CMO Secretary and Officer on Special Duty to the Chief Minister respectively.The reason: the decision of former Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to appoint several retired bureaucrats as advisors to manage the affairs of different departments. But, since the new government is in place, Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari has issued orders rescinding the extension of tenure of these advisors given by the previous government while the relatively newly appointed advisors had been shown the door.During Mr. Rao\u2019s tenure, retired IAS officer S. Narsing Rao was appointed as Principal Secretary and year 2000 batch officer Rahul Bojja was appointed as Secretary to Chief Minister.K. Bhupal Reddy, former IFS officer, was the Special Secretary in the CMO while P. Raja Sekhar Reddy, another Special Secretary to CM was previously in the Employees Provident Fund Organisation under Ministry of Labour. He resigned and joined the CMO after his five-year term. Official sources said that the new Chief Minister will have to go for reshuffle of the bureaucracy and choose his team. With the Congress party making it clear that its first priority was implementation of the Six Guarantees, the onus would be to have a robust mechanism with team of committed officers to oversee the programme\u2019s progress.There have been instances of several bureaucrats serving in the same post for over six to seven years. Many IAS officers were given additional charge and the arrangement went on for many years.The BRS government from 2014 re-appointed several retired bureaucrats as advisors. Notable among them were Rajiv Sharma, Somesh Kumar, S.K. Joshi, A.K. Goel, A. Rama Lakshman, B.V. Papa Rao, K.V. Ramana Chary, G. R. Reddy (retired IES), A.K. Khan and Anurag Sharma (both retired IPS). Two other retired Special Chief Secretary level officers Adhar Sinha and Rani Kumudini were reappointed and continued in the same posts they held on the day of superannuation. The All India Civil list have 170 bureaucrats allotted to Telangana. The Chief Secretary A Santhi Kumari is 1989 batch IAS officer.

Raja Sekhar Reddy, another Special Secretary to CM was previously in the Employees Provident Fund Organisation under Ministry of Labour. He resigned and joined the CMO after his five-year term. Official sources said that the new Chief Minister will have to go for reshuffle of the bureaucracy and choose his team. With the Congress party making it clear that its first priority was implementation of the Six Guarantees, the onus would be to have a robust mechanism with team of committed officers to oversee the programme\u2019s progress.There have been instances of several bureaucrats serving in the same post for over six to seven years. Many IAS officers were given additional charge and the arrangement went on for many years.The BRS government from 2014 re-appointed several retired bureaucrats as advisors. Notable among them were Rajiv Sharma, Somesh Kumar, S.K. Joshi, A.K. Goel, A. Rama Lakshman, B.V. Papa Rao, K.V. Ramana Chary, G. R. Reddy (retired IES), A.K. Khan and Anurag Sharma (both retired IPS). Two other retired Special Chief Secretary level officers Adhar Sinha and Rani Kumudini were reappointed and continued in the same posts they held on the day of superannuation. The All India Civil list have 170 bureaucrats allotted to Telangana. The Chief Secretary A Santhi Kumari is 1989 batch IAS officer.

Photo: Special Arrangement Amidst heightened efforts by the authorities to regulate the influx of devotees, the war of words between political parties on the issue continued to rage on Monday.In view of the raging criticism, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is slated to convene a high-level meeting on Tuesday morning to asses the situation. The meeting, to be held online, will be attended by Devaswom Minister K. Radhakrishnan, the State police Chief, the Chief Secretary, president of the Travancore Devaswom Board, and so on.Earlier in the day, Mr. Radhakrishnan said that regulating the inflow of pilgrims to Sabarimala beyond a point might not be feasible. \u201cTo enable all devotees to pass through the 18 holy steps, some regulations needed to be brought in. The devotees and the media should understand this,\u201d he said.Lack of amenitiesThe Opposition, however, refused to be reasoned out and escalated its attack over the alleged inability of the State government to ensure basic amenities for the devotees. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan accused the State government of committing serious negligence at Sabarimala.\u201cThe officials deployed on duty are not experienced enough to handle such a huge crowd. The Ministers who are responsible to coordinate the event are refusing to perform their duty and are busy touring the State instead,\u201d he said. Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, who visited a Sabarimala stop-over point at Pathanamthitta during the day, too unleashed a scathing attack on the State government for the lack of preparations at Sabarimala. To ascertain the issues faced by devotees at Sabarimala, a team of leaders from the United Democratic Front (UDF) will visit Pampa on Tuesday, said front convener M.M. Hassan. The team, comprising MLAs Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and Mons Joseph, will hold discussions with the officials concerned.Cold warThe Bharatiya Janata Party too mounted attack on the government with party State president K. Surendran urging the government to end the alleged cold war between the TDB and the police. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the State government is attempting to sabotage a pilgrimage that is bringing crores of rupees in revenue to the State every year,\u2019\u2019 he told media persons in Pathanamthitta.Later in the day, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activists took out a protest march at Nilackal against the alleged government apathy towards the Sabarimala pilgrims and clashed with the police.

Photo: Special Arrangement Amidst heightened efforts by the authorities to regulate the influx of devotees, the war of words between political parties on the issue continued to rage on Monday.In view of the raging criticism, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is slated to convene a high-level meeting on Tuesday morning to asses the situation. The meeting, to be held online, will be attended by Devaswom Minister K. Radhakrishnan, the State police Chief, the Chief Secretary, president of the Travancore Devaswom Board, and so on.Earlier in the day, Mr. Radhakrishnan said that regulating the inflow of pilgrims to Sabarimala beyond a point might not be feasible. \u201cTo enable all devotees to pass through the 18 holy steps, some regulations needed to be brought in. The devotees and the media should understand this,\u201d he said.Lack of amenitiesThe Opposition, however, refused to be reasoned out and escalated its attack over the alleged inability of the State government to ensure basic amenities for the devotees. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan accused the State government of committing serious negligence at Sabarimala.\u201cThe officials deployed on duty are not experienced enough to handle such a huge crowd. The Ministers who are responsible to coordinate the event are refusing to perform their duty and are busy touring the State instead,\u201d he said. Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, who visited a Sabarimala stop-over point at Pathanamthitta during the day, too unleashed a scathing attack on the State government for the lack of preparations at Sabarimala. To ascertain the issues faced by devotees at Sabarimala, a team of leaders from the United Democratic Front (UDF) will visit Pampa on Tuesday, said front convener M.M. Hassan. The team, comprising MLAs Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and Mons Joseph, will hold discussions with the officials concerned.Cold warThe Bharatiya Janata Party too mounted attack on the government with party State president K. Surendran urging the government to end the alleged cold war between the TDB and the police. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the State government is attempting to sabotage a pilgrimage that is bringing crores of rupees in revenue to the State every year,\u2019\u2019 he told media persons in Pathanamthitta.Later in the day, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activists took out a protest march at Nilackal against the alleged government apathy towards the Sabarimala pilgrims and clashed with the police.

Mr. Bhola stated that if the evasion of excise duty or concealment of production details was suspected, a thorough investigation would be conducted.Upon initial examination, it was found that Baldeo Sahu and Group of Companies Limited, a company at the center of controversy, owned seven out of 14 OS shops in Jharsuguda, five out of 15 in Rayagada, and four out of 32 in Sambalpur district. However, sources suggested that proprietors of numerous OS shops were connected to the Sahu family, controlling OS shops across various western Odisha districts.A senior official asserted that the accumulated cash likely did not originate from distillery business profits, as the industry did not yield super profits. The undisclosed cash found in the distillery premises may have been intended for political purposes.Meanwhile, the State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged an agitation and burnt the effigy of State Excise Minister Ashwini Patra protesting that the faulty State Excise Policy was the reason behind amassing of cash by OS shop operators.

The report could serve as a repository of road safety solutions that can be utilised by different stakeholders across the country.The annual pilgrimage season to visit Sabarimala temple from mid-November to end-January saw 16 deaths and 77 injuries in 2009-2010. As the temple can only be accessed by narrow roads on the hilly terrain of Pathanamthitta district, there would often be traffic congestion either due to road crashes or vehicle breakdowns. This would also further impact operations of emergency vehicles for rescue and relief efforts and servicing of stranded vehicles. According to the MVD, nearly four crore pilgrims travelled in 80 lakh vehicles in 2017-2018.So, the MVD identified 382 km of roads leading to Sabarimala for the Safe Zone Project. The project resulted in 100% reduction in deaths or zero fatalities in 2020-2021. There was also a 90% reduction in injuries, which dropped from 77 to seven injuries during the 10-year period.On the groundThe report identifies a slew of measures which resulted in the drastic impact. Key among them was deployment of personnel on the ground, which included 15 patrol teams of 45 officers from MVD with vehicles fitted with GPS, wireless, fire extinguishers, and safety devices. These measures ensured parking discipline and tended to vehicle pile-ups and crashes. They were also aided by three 24/7 control rooms with communication facilities.Ambulance services are also ensured to provide emergency medical care. Vehicles are also provided breakdown assistance with the support of 300 people in 90 mechanical teams along with three mobile repair units with sufficient spares, five cranes and 50 recovery vans. Arrangements for supplying fuel to stranded vehicles were also made.There were also awareness campaigns conducted among guruswamis and drivers with campaign material in six languages distributed at major check posts and toll booths.The Sabarimala project is among the 13 \u201cgood practices\u201d compiled in the report that have either been implemented in the past or are currently under implementation across various States in the country. To gather these practices, all the relevant stakeholders, including police, transport and health departments, of all 28 States and 8 Union Territories across the country were contacted through questionnaires, which was followed by secondary research.The report recommends that such the Sabarimala project could potentially be replicated on other religious tourist circuits such as the Uttarakhand Char Dham Yatra that also witnesses a high number of road crash fatalities.

The judge passed the interim directions after hearing a writ petition filed by Anjuman-e-Alavi of Shia Imamia Ithna Achari Akbhari Society represented by its secretary Asma Fatima. After hearing contentions of the petitioner\u2019s counsel, the judge also instructed the Telangana State Waqf Board to file a counter affidavit explaining the objections over not permitting women into the Ibadat Khana. The petitioner stated that representations were presented to the Waqf Board on October 14, 16 and 18 requesting the authorities to allow Shia Muslim women inside the Ibadat Khana. The writ petition was filed since the Muttawali committee and the Waqf Board did not respond to the representations, according to the petitioner. While not permitting Shia Muslim women of Akbhari sect, the Muttawali committee was allowing Shia Muslim women of Usooli sect inside Ibadat Khana for carrying out activities which were not mentioned in Wakfnama, the petitioner contended. Observing that \u2018this discrimination was bad\u2019, the petitioner stated that despite knowing all this the Waqf Board remained mute spectator. The issue was taken to the notice of the local police too but the latter declined to interfere, the petitioner said. Convening majlis, jashns and religious prayers was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution of India. According to the petitioner\u2019s counsel, even the Waqf Board issued a proceeding (no Gen/DM/Z-1/06) allowing Shia Muslim women to conduct majlis, jashns and prayers at Ibadat Khana. The Waqf Board counsel informed the bench that entry of women inside the Ibadat Khana was subject to the rules and guidelines of holy book. Responding to the contentions of the counsel, Justice Nagesh Bheemapaka said that the Constitution had provided equal rights to the women. The judge cited excerpts over equality for women mentioned in different religious scriptures and noted that one cannot deny equal rights to women.

The case was registered based on a complaint lodged by M. Laxmaiah, watchman at the office of the Director of Animal Husbandry in Shantinagar of Masab Tank in the city.

Through its judgment, the court has upheld the sovereignty and integrity of India, something that is cherished by every Indian. The court rightly observed that the decision taken on August 5, 2019 was done with the purpose of enhancing constitutional integration and not disintegration.

But, for the past seven decades, these places have witnessed the worst form of violence and instability, something which the wonderful people never deserved.Also read | Ominously anti-federal: On the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment on Article 370 and J&K\u2019s special statusConfused society Unfortunately, due to centuries of colonisation, most notably economic and mental subjugation, we became a confused society of sorts. Rather than taking a clear position on very basic things, we allowed duality, leading to confusion. Sadly, Jammu and Kashmir became a big victim of such a mindset. At the time of Independence, we had a choice of making a fresh start for national integration. Instead, we decided to continue with the confused-society approach even if it meant ignoring the long-term national interests. Supreme Court upholds the abrogation of Article 370, says it is a \u2018temporary provision\u2019 | LIVE updates I have had the opportunity of being connected with the Jammu and Kashmir Andolan from a very early part of my life. I belong to an ideological framework where Jammu and Kashmir was not merely a political issue. But, it was about addressing the aspirations of society. Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee held an important portfolio in the Nehru Cabinet and could have remained in government for a long time. Yet, he quit the Cabinet over the Kashmir issue and preferred the tough road ahead, even if it meant paying with his life. His efforts and sacrifice led to crores of Indians becoming emotionally attached with the Kashmir issue. Years later, Atalji, at a public meeting in Srinagar, gave the powerful message of Insaniyat, Jamhooriyat, and Kashmiriyat, which has also always been a source of great inspiration. It was always my firm belief that what had happened in Jammu and Kashmir was a great betrayal \u2014 to our nation and to the people living there. It was also my strong desire to do whatever I can to remove this blot, this injustice done to the people. I have always wanted to work to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. ALSO READ SC verdict on Article 370 \u2014 Over 12,000 panchayat seats vacant in J&K since 2018 In very basic words, Articles 370 and 35(A) were like major obstacles. It seemed like an unbreakable wall and the sufferers were the poor and downtrodden. Articles 370 and 35(A) ensured that the people of Jammu and Kashmir never got the rights and development that the rest of their fellow Indians got. Due to these Articles, a distance was created between people belonging to the same nation. Due to this distance, many people from our nation who wanted to work to solve the problems of Jammu and Kashmir were unable to do so even if they clearly felt the pain of the people there. As a karyakarta who has seen the issue closely over the past several decades, I had a nuanced understanding of the specifics and the complexities of the issue. Yet, I was crystal clear about one thing \u2014 that the people of Jammu and Kashmir want development and they want to contribute to the development of India based on their strengths and skills. They also want a better quality of life for their children, a life free from violence and uncertainty. Thus, while serving the people of Jammu and Kashmir, we gave primacy to three pillars \u2014 understanding of the citizens\u2019 concerns, building trust through supportive actions, and prioritising development, development, and more development. In 2014, just after we assumed office, deadly floods struck Jammu and Kashmir, with a lot of damage in the Kashmir Valley. In September 2014, I went to Srinagar to assess the situation and also announced \u20b91,000 crore as a special assistance for rehabilitation, signalling our government\u2019s commitment to supporting the people during crises. I had the opportunity to meet people from different walks of life, and there was one common thread in these interactions \u2014 the people not only wanted development but they also wanted freedom from the rampant corruption prevailing for decades. The same year, I decided not to mark Deepavali in remembrance of those we lost in Jammu and Kashmir. I also decided to be in Jammu and Kashmir on Deepavali day. In order to further strengthen Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s development journey, we decided that our government Ministers would frequently go there and interact with people directly. These frequent visits also played a crucial role in building goodwill in Jammu and Kashmir. From May 2014 to March 2019, over 150 ministerial visits took place. This is a record in itself. The special package of 2015 was a significant step in addressing the developmental needs of Jammu and Kashmir. It contained initiatives for infrastructure development, job creation, tourism promotion, and support to the handicraft industry. ALSO READ Supreme Court verdict on Article 370 disappointing, says Sajad Lone We harnessed the power of sports in Jammu and Kashmir, recognising its potential to ignite the dreams of the youth. Through sporting initiatives, we witnessed the transformational impact of athletic pursuits on their aspirations and futures. Sporting venues were upgraded, training programmes were organised, and coaches were made available. One of the most unique things was to encourage the setting up of local football clubs. The results were outstanding. The name of the talented footballer Afshan Ashiq comes to my mind. In December 2014, she was part of a stone-pelting group in Srinagar but with the right encouragement she turned to football. She was sent for training and excelled in the game. I recall interacting with her at one of the Fit India Dialogues, where I said it\u2019s time to move over \u201cBend it like Beckham\u201d because it is now \u201cAce it like Afshan\u201d. Other youngsters began to shine in kickboxing, karate, and more. Panchayat polls The panchayat polls were also a watershed moment in the region\u2019s quest for all-round development. Once again, we were faced with a choice of either remaining in power or standing by our principles \u2014 the choice was never tough and we let go of a government but preferred that the ideals that we stand for, the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir are given top priority. The success of panchayat polls indicated the democratic nature of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. My mind went back to an interaction I had with pradhans from the villages. Among other issues, I made a request to them \u2014 that at no point must schools be burnt and that must be ensured. I was delighted to see that this was adhered to. After all, if schools are burnt, the biggest sufferers are the small children.The historic day of August 5 is etched in the hearts and minds of every Indian. Our Parliament passed the historic decision to abrogate Article 370. Since then, much has changed in Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. The judicial court verdict came in December 2023 but seeing the wave of development across Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh, the people\u2019s court has given a resounding thumbs up to Parliament\u2019s decision of abolishing Articles 370 and 35(A) for four years now. At a political level, the past four years have been marked with a renewed faith in grassroots democracy. The women, tribal people, SCs, STs, and the marginalised sections of society were not getting their due. At the same time, the aspirations of Ladakh were totally ignored. August 5, 2019 changed all that. All Central laws now apply without fear or favour. Representation has also got more widespread \u2014 a three-tier Panchayati Raj system is in place, BDC elections have been held, and refugee communities who were all but forgotten have begun to enjoy the fruits of development. Key Central government schemes have attained saturation levels, thus covering all sections of society. These include the Saubhagya and Ujjwala schemes. ALSO READ Article 370: Amit Shah welcomes SC verdict, terms it a tribute to martyrs Strides have been made in housing, tap water connection, and financial inclusion. Healthcare, otherwise a major challenge for the people, has witnessed upgradation of infrastructure. All the villages achieved ODF-plus status. Government vacancies, which were otherwise a den of corruption and favouritism, have been filled in a transparent and process-driven manner. Other indicators like IMR have shown betterment. The boost to infrastructure and tourism has been for everyone to see. The credit for this naturally goes to the resilience of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who have shown time and again that they want only development and are willing to be drivers of this positive change. Earlier, there was a question mark on the status of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. Now, there are only exclamation marks about record growth, record development, and record tourist inflow. In its verdict on December 11, the Supreme Court has strengthened the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat \u2014 it has reminded us that what defines us are the bonds of unity and a shared commitment to good governance. Today, every child born in Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh is born with a clean canvas, where he or she can paint a future full of vibrant aspirations. Today, the dreams of the people are no longer prisoners of the past but are possibilities of the future. After all, development, democracy, and dignity have replaced disillusionment, disappointment and despondency.

Ramakrishnan COMMents SHARE Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL An official says the accumulation of silt and semi-solid substance in the marsh has reduced the capacity of the wetland to absorb floodwater. | Photo Credit: M. Karunakaran The State government is contemplating two options \u2013 the formation of a \u201ccut and cover\u201d channel from Pallikaranai marshland to the sea and regular dredging of the marsh \u2013 to address the problem of flooding in Velachery and the southern outskirts of the city. The first option was mooted nearly 20 years ago and dropped in October 2014. While the second is also nothing new, authorities would like to tread their path carefully in view of possible objections from green activists. Last week\u2019s torrential rain caused by Cyclone Michaung left Velachery and the city\u2019s southern suburbs flooded. Also called \u201cstraight cut\u201d, the cut and cover\u201d channel was to complement the existing arrangement of water draining from the marsh into Muttukadu backwaters through South Buckingham Canal and Okkiyam Maduvu. Its carrying capacity was to be 3,500 cubic feet per second (cusecs). When the idea was mooted during the 2005 flood, the cost was estimated at \u20b963 crore, including \u20b930 crore for land acquisition, said a report published by The Hindu on November 8, 2006. Eventually, the cost was revised as \u20b9131.9 crore four years later. In 2012, the Water Resources Department (WRD) proposed to drop the work as the alignment would pass through a private resort-cum-amusement park, and this would increase the land acquisition cost to \u20b9100 crore. In October 2014, the State government agreed with the proposal and scrapped the project, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General\u2019s (CAG) report of 2017 on the flood of 2015. The CAG had even pulled up the government for \u201clack of seriousness\u201d in fulfilling the objective of providing a permanent solution to the inundation problems of thickly populated Velachery. However, about 10 years ago, improvements were made to the South Buckingham Canal from Okkiyum Maduvu to Muttukadu backwaters to carry 9,000 cusecs, a fact that had been acknowledged by the CAG. Last week, a maximum of 11,000 cusecs would have flown through the marsh. The proposed \u201ccut and cover\u201d channel can carry at least 4,500-5,000 cusecs, says a senior official. As for the other option, the State government, in September 2021, gave an undertaking before the Madras High Court that no dredging work would be undertaken in future, except when such a necessity arises out of removal of encroachments from the waterbody. This was in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by an environmental activist. At that time, the government also told the court that the removal of silt from the Pallikaranai marshland was done in the past, \u201cafter obtaining expert advice, only to maintain better water level in the wetland.\u201d The official says the accumulation of silt and semi-solid substance in the marsh has reduced the capacity of the wetland to absorb floodwater, which comes from about 30 tanks in and around the city. The government is keen on ensuring that the ecosystem of the marsh does not get disturbed even as it plans to undertake dredging, which is for the purpose of providing relief to people in Velachery and surrounding areas, the official adds.

RAGU The School Education Department of Tamil Nadu on Monday said action would be taken against the headmaster of a Government High School in Korattur, who had some Class IV students clean the overhead water tanks on the premises. In a viral video, the boys were seen standing precariously on the water tank while trying to clean it. The department recently released \u20b91.9 crore for government schools in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu, and Kancheepuram districts for cleaning their premises after they were badly hit during Cyclone Michaung, as per a release. However, many faculty of government and government-aided schools alleged they had to spend money out of their pockets for cleaning and repair works. The schools, which reopened on Monday, were supposed to be cleaned and ready for classes. \u201cOnly \u20b91.9 crore was released for all four districts i.e \u20b92,500 per school, which compelled all principals to spend,\u201d said a headmaster of a school in Tirvallur district. According to the department, the funds were released to the Public Works Department (PWD), which undertakes the cleaning works. It directed the schools to pump out water, clear trees, check electrical wiring, among other activities. \u201cI had to spend nearly \u20b95,000 out of my pocket. PWD personnel visited but no real work was done. None of us were consulted on the works to be carried out. So, how does the department know what should be done,\u201d said a teacher of a government school in Tiruvottiyur. Parents of a Government High School in Mangadu are concerned about a temporary roof installed by teachers last year. Built using donations from the public and faculty, it leaks during showers. They are calling for action from the School Education Department authorities. Meanwhile, in government-aided schools, restoration depends on donations, unlike Corporation schools, where respective ward councillors take cognisance of the issues, as per a source linked to an aided school in Egmore. Other teachers agreed that this had been the case for many years. \u201cThe department just asks us to reopen. The onus has always been on the teachers to work things out,\u201d said a member of the Secondary Grade Seniority Teachers\u2019 Association. J.

Education visa-related commitments under the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement will not be affected by the new Migration Strategy of Australia announced on December 11, sources here have said. The affirmation came soon after Canberra announced the new policy for guiding the post-COVID waves of migration to Australia as sources expressed confidence that Indian students will continue to grow in numbers in Australian educational institutions.\u201cCommitments agreed between India and Australia under the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (AI-ECTA) will be upheld under the new Migration Strategy. This means that Indian graduates will continue to be eligible to stay on a Temporary Graduate Visa for two years for a bachelor degree, three years for the completion of a Masters degree and 4 years for a completion of a PhD,\u201d said a source.As part of the ECTA finalised in December 2022, Australia had agreed to allow stays up to 18 months upon completion of diploma or trade qualifications. Similarly, Canberra had agreed to allow stays up to two and three years upon completion of Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees. Under the same set of commitments, doctoral degree holders could stay up to four years after completion of their degrees. Sources on Monday indicated that these commitments would remain on track though there is expected to be \u201cmore rigorous scrutiny\u201d of some cases where the visa application appears to be spurious.Sources assured that such preventive measures are not meant for genuine seekers of higher education and indicated that some scrutiny may also be aimed at ensuring English language requirement, adding, \u201cThe Government will continue to welcome high-quality students seeking out educational opportunities in Australia.

Education visa-related commitments under the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement will not be affected by the new Migration Strategy of Australia announced on December 11, sources here have said. The affirmation came soon after Canberra announced the new policy for guiding the post-COVID waves of migration to Australia as sources expressed confidence that Indian students will continue to grow in numbers in Australian educational institutions.\u201cCommitments agreed between India and Australia under the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (AI-ECTA) will be upheld under the new Migration Strategy. This means that Indian graduates will continue to be eligible to stay on a Temporary Graduate Visa for two years for a bachelor degree, three years for the completion of a Masters degree and 4 years for a completion of a PhD,\u201d said a source.As part of the ECTA finalised in December 2022, Australia had agreed to allow stays up to 18 months upon completion of diploma or trade qualifications. Similarly, Canberra had agreed to allow stays up to two and three years upon completion of Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees. Under the same set of commitments, doctoral degree holders could stay up to four years after completion of their degrees. Sources on Monday indicated that these commitments would remain on track though there is expected to be \u201cmore rigorous scrutiny\u201d of some cases where the visa application appears to be spurious.Sources assured that such preventive measures are not meant for genuine seekers of higher education and indicated that some scrutiny may also be aimed at ensuring English language requirement, adding, \u201cThe Government will continue to welcome high-quality students seeking out educational opportunities in Australia. I see no reason why Indian student numbers shouldn\u2019t continue to grow.\u201dAn individual privy to the Australian policy also stated that the new Migration Policy may encourage semi-skilled workers to explore opportunities in Australia and said machine operators, drivers, and heavy machine operators are a few of the professions in Australia that may open up for semi-skilled workers from these segments in India.

The secretary is also empowered to assign duties to the officials of the local bodies to take necessary measures for waste management. The fine imposed by the secretary against dumping in public and private land has been increased to \u20b95,000.The secretary can spend an amount not exceeding \u20b92 lakh from the related fund to carry out the duties assigned to him by informing the president.M.B.

Citizens providing information about littering will be rewarded to ensure the involvement of the public and make them aware of its importance.It is the duty of the owners and occupiers of the shops to keep their premises clean and to ensure that no customer litters or sets fire to waste. The local authorities can also confiscate vehicles used for improper disposal of solid or liquid waste. The local self-government should prioritise finding its own or private land for waste management. If needed, private land can be acquired according to the existing laws. If any waste generator defaults in paying the user fee in 90 days, it will go to arrears of public tax with a penalty of 50% per month. The secretary can also deny local self-government services to those who do not pay the user fee. The waste generated during meetings and public programmes has to be disposed of permanently. The local bodies would have to be informed of events where more than 100 people gather, at least three days in advance. The waste generated must be handed over to the designated refuse collectors or agencies upon payment of a fee fixed by local authorities, according to the amended laws.

Citizens providing information about littering will be rewarded to ensure the involvement of the public and make them aware of its importance.It is the duty of the owners and occupiers of the shops to keep their premises clean and to ensure that no customer litters or sets fire to waste. The local authorities can also confiscate vehicles used for improper disposal of solid or liquid waste. The local self-government should prioritise finding its own or private land for waste management. If needed, private land can be acquired according to the existing laws. If any waste generator defaults in paying the user fee in 90 days, it will go to arrears of public tax with a penalty of 50% per month. The secretary can also deny local self-government services to those who do not pay the user fee. The waste generated during meetings and public programmes has to be disposed of permanently. The local bodies would have to be informed of events where more than 100 people gather, at least three days in advance. The waste generated must be handed over to the designated refuse collectors or agencies upon payment of a fee fixed by local authorities, according to the amended laws.

The study, undertaken by SaveLIFE Foundation in cooperation with the World Bank Group and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), revealed that the stretch had witnessed a crash severity of 58.7 in 2014, higher than the national average of 28.5 in the same year.The 38.1% reduction was seen because of the interventions of the four Es -- Enforcement, Education, Emergency Response, and Engineering -- implemented on the stretch. The project was implemented by the Roads and Buildings Department, Telangana, said the report released by Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari.The Hyderabad-Bijapur Corridor runs through the districts of Rangareddy and Vikarabad. It extends from the APPA Junction and intersects the Outer Ring Road (ORR) up to the Karnataka border. The route travels through several mandals, villages, and electoral districts including Moinabad, Chevella, Manneguda, and Parigi.\u201cIn 2014, the Hyderabad-Bijapur Corridor faced a critical situation with 143 road crashes and 84 fatalities.

Similar to how the Women and Children\u2019s Hospital Block of District Hospital in Tandur was provided with a new Level-III trauma care centre, the capacity of existing hospitals near other crash-prone areas can be upgraded,\u201d said the report.The report also highlighted practices such as the Zero Fatality Corridor (ZFC) project on National Highway 48 (Old Mumbai-Pune Highway), which registered a 61% decrease in fatalities between 2018 and 2021. Similarly, the Belgaum-Yaragatti Highway\u2019s Safe Corridor Demonstration Project (SCDP) in Karnataka recorded a notable 54% reduction in deaths over three years from 2015 to 2018.

December 11, 2023 11:19 pm | Updated 11:20 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram The Hindu Bureau COMMents SHARE Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that the idea of a developed India could be realised before 2047 through the restoration of India\u2019s intellectual heritage.He was speaking at the \u2018Viksit Bharat @2047 - Voice of Youth\u2019 programme hosted by Raj Bhavan here on Monday. \u201cA developed India is not an idea that is alien or inaccessible to us. Even before the European Renaissance began, India\u2019s intellectual heritage was recognised by the world. Arab scholars known for their intellectual superiority in the ninth and tenth centuries have recorded borrowing from Indian texts. There is also the Prophet\u2019s word about the cool breeze of knowledge coming from India,\u201d he said.In Indian philosophy, the ultimate aim of life is not the search for pleasure, but the pursuit of knowledge. Moreover, a knowledge society like India has no other choice but to be developed. Universities have a major role to play in accelerating India\u2019s journey towards development. Not only knowledge but also emotional balance should be ensured in the youth. Apart from parents, teachers, and the public are also responsible for this,\u201d he said, adding that universities should be able to inculcate in every student awareness that they have a role to play in making social transformation a reality.He reminded the researchers that the goal should be to harness knowledge for the betterment of the world. \u201cThose in universities are more knowledgeable and have more learning facilities than others. Therefore, you have an obligation to make a significant contribution to the society,\u201d he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event at an online function and launched the Viksit Bharat @2047 Ideas Portal. Union Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan also spoke at the event.Vice-chancellors, researchers, and students participated in the discussion. Vice-chancellors Dr B.

Even before the European Renaissance began, India\u2019s intellectual heritage was recognised by the world. Arab scholars known for their intellectual superiority in the ninth and tenth centuries have recorded borrowing from Indian texts. There is also the Prophet\u2019s word about the cool breeze of knowledge coming from India,\u201d he said.In Indian philosophy, the ultimate aim of life is not the search for pleasure, but the pursuit of knowledge. Moreover, a knowledge society like India has no other choice but to be developed. Universities have a major role to play in accelerating India\u2019s journey towards development. Not only knowledge but also emotional balance should be ensured in the youth. Apart from parents, teachers, and the public are also responsible for this,\u201d he said, adding that universities should be able to inculcate in every student awareness that they have a role to play in making social transformation a reality.He reminded the researchers that the goal should be to harness knowledge for the betterment of the world. \u201cThose in universities are more knowledgeable and have more learning facilities than others. Therefore, you have an obligation to make a significant contribution to the society,\u201d he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event at an online function and launched the Viksit Bharat @2047 Ideas Portal. Union Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan also spoke at the event.Vice-chancellors, researchers, and students participated in the discussion. Vice-chancellors Dr B.

Jadi Jamalpur, a far-flung village in Bodhan mandal in Nizamabad district, celebrated the episcopal silver jubilee celebrations of Rt Rev Mallavarapu Prakash, Archbishop of Visakhapatnam, on his completion of 25 years as bishop/archbishop.Bordering Maharashtra, Jadi Jamalpur residents turned out in large numbers to celebrate the occasion as the Archbishop hails from this village. After being installed as Bishop by the Vatican, he served the other regions of the undivided AP, initially Kadapa Diocese (1998), then Vijayawada Diocese (2002) and finally Visakhapatnam (2012) diocese, which included Vizianagaram and erstwhile East Godavari districts also. The last appointment to Visakhapatnam archdiocese was made in the presence of the Pope\u2019s nuncio Pinnachio Salvotore. A striking aspect of Rt Rev Prakash is that he researched Vedas and scriptures like Bhagavatham at Gnanadeepa Vidyapeeth, Pune, that often took him to Varanasi for a comparative study of religions. After obtaining Ph.D in these and completing religious studies at the Papal seminary, again Pune, he went to the US where he did his post-graduation in theology in Loyola University, Chicago. The entire village wore a festival look as the Archbishop was taken around in flower decked jeep to the St. Joseph\u2019s church.

December 11, 2023 11:02 pm | Updated 11:02 pm IST Shivani Vij,Shrutanjaya Bhardwaj COMMents SHARE Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL Supporters of Bihar Janata Dal (U) Most Backward Cell celebrate during a procession after the release of the Caste Census, in Patna on October 4. | Photo Credit: ANI The story so far: On November 17, the Governor of Bihar approved two laws increasing the quantum of reservations in jobs and education in the State to 75%, including 20% for Scheduled Castes, 2% for Scheduled Tribes, 18% for Other Backward Classes, and 25% for Extremely Backward Classes, and 10% for economically weaker sections (EWS). The two laws have once again sparked debate around the permissible limits of reservations in India, particularly in view of the \u201c50%\u201d limit prescribed by the Supreme Court of India in the Mandal Commission case (Indra Sawhney, 1992), as well as the court\u2019s emphasis on \u201cadequate\u201d representation of the oppressed classes as opposed to \u201cproportionate representation\u201d. What is the 50% rule? The Supreme Court has historically maintained that reservations, whether in jobs or education, should not exceed 50% of the total seats/posts. In 1963, a seven judge bench in M.R. Balaji explained that reservations were in the nature of an \u201cexception\u201c or \u201cspecial provision\u201c under our constitutional scheme. Therefore, they cannot be provided for more than 50% of the posts or seats. Though this understanding of reservations changed in 1976 \u2014 with it being recognised that reservations are a facet of equality rather than an exception to it \u2014 the 50% limit has remained unaltered.A nine judge bench in the Mandal commission case in 1990 reaffirmed the 50% limit and held that it is a binding rule, and not merely a matter of prudence. However, it is not a rule without exceptions. A State can exceed the limit in exceptional circumstances, that is, to provide reservations to communities which hail from far flung areas of the country and have been kept out of the mainstream of the society. This is not a geographical test but a social one. Besides, last year, the Supreme Court upheld the 103rd Constitutional Amendment which provides for 10% additional reservations to the EWS. This means, for the time being, that the 50% limit applies only to non-EWS reservations, and States are permitted to reserve a total of 60% of the seats/posts including EWS reservations. What do laws in Bihar state? In January 2023, the Bihar government announced a caste based census/survey to be conducted across the State. The results of this Census were announced in October. Shortly thereafter, the two Bills (now laws) where introduced in the Legislative Assembly. Two striking aspects of these laws deserve to be noticed. The first is the obvious breach of the 50% (now 60%) ceiling limit. If and when the laws are challenged in court, the government of Bihar will have to prove that there case falls within the exception carved out in the Mandal Commission case. That is, the communities to whom reservations have been granted hail from far flung areas or have been kept out of the social mainstream. The second is the justification offered by the State government for this breach. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressly stated on the floor of the House that the intent is to increase the quantum of reservations in view of the results of the caste Census. However, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the State cannot fix the quantum of reservation simply in proportion to the population of the reserved classes. This is because the only valid aim behind reservations is to secure \u201cadequate\u201d representation of the depressed classes, which is different from \u201cproportionate\u201d representation. Therefore, one major challenge before the State government will be to defend the motive behind the move. Bihar is not the first to cross the line. Other States that have already surpassed the 50% limit, even excluding the EWS quota, are Chhattisgarh (72%), Tamil Nadu (69%, under a 1994 Act protected under the ninth Schedule of the Constitution), and several north-eastern States including Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland (80% each). Lakshadweep has a whopping 100% reservations for Scheduled Tribes. Previous attempts by Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been struck down by the courts. What next? The Bihar Government appears to be following the footsteps of other States that have already breached the 50% ceiling limit. It seems inevitable that the validity of the two Bihar laws will be carried to the Supreme Court, and the Court will be urged to reconsider the 50% ceiling limit entirely. It remains to be seen whether the court will be inclined to do so. Shivani Vij and Shrutanjaya Bhardwaj are advocates practising before the Supreme Court of India.

In 1963, a seven judge bench in M.R. Balaji explained that reservations were in the nature of an \u201cexception\u201c or \u201cspecial provision\u201c under our constitutional scheme. Therefore, they cannot be provided for more than 50% of the posts or seats. Though this understanding of reservations changed in 1976 \u2014 with it being recognised that reservations are a facet of equality rather than an exception to it \u2014 the 50% limit has remained unaltered.A nine judge bench in the Mandal commission case in 1990 reaffirmed the 50% limit and held that it is a binding rule, and not merely a matter of prudence. However, it is not a rule without exceptions. A State can exceed the limit in exceptional circumstances, that is, to provide reservations to communities which hail from far flung areas of the country and have been kept out of the mainstream of the society. This is not a geographical test but a social one. Besides, last year, the Supreme Court upheld the 103rd Constitutional Amendment which provides for 10% additional reservations to the EWS. This means, for the time being, that the 50% limit applies only to non-EWS reservations, and States are permitted to reserve a total of 60% of the seats/posts including EWS reservations. What do laws in Bihar state? In January 2023, the Bihar government announced a caste based census/survey to be conducted across the State. The results of this Census were announced in October. Shortly thereafter, the two Bills (now laws) where introduced in the Legislative Assembly. Two striking aspects of these laws deserve to be noticed. The first is the obvious breach of the 50% (now 60%) ceiling limit. If and when the laws are challenged in court, the government of Bihar will have to prove that there case falls within the exception carved out in the Mandal Commission case. That is, the communities to whom reservations have been granted hail from far flung areas or have been kept out of the social mainstream. The second is the justification offered by the State government for this breach. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressly stated on the floor of the House that the intent is to increase the quantum of reservations in view of the results of the caste Census. However, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the State cannot fix the quantum of reservation simply in proportion to the population of the reserved classes. This is because the only valid aim behind reservations is to secure \u201cadequate\u201d representation of the depressed classes, which is different from \u201cproportionate\u201d representation. Therefore, one major challenge before the State government will be to defend the motive behind the move. Bihar is not the first to cross the line. Other States that have already surpassed the 50% limit, even excluding the EWS quota, are Chhattisgarh (72%), Tamil Nadu (69%, under a 1994 Act protected under the ninth Schedule of the Constitution), and several north-eastern States including Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland (80% each). Lakshadweep has a whopping 100% reservations for Scheduled Tribes. Previous attempts by Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been struck down by the courts. What next? The Bihar Government appears to be following the footsteps of other States that have already breached the 50% ceiling limit. It seems inevitable that the validity of the two Bihar laws will be carried to the Supreme Court, and the Court will be urged to reconsider the 50% ceiling limit entirely. It remains to be seen whether the court will be inclined to do so. Shivani Vij and Shrutanjaya Bhardwaj are advocates practising before the Supreme Court of India.

Mahadevan and Mohammed Shaffiq deferred their verdict after hearing Senior Counsel V. Raghavachari and advocates Narmadha Sampath and Preetika Dwivedi for the three PIL petitioners and Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram for the State.The Bench also heard senior counsel P.R. Raman for Racing Promotions Private Limited with which the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for conducting the street race in Chennai for the first time.The petitioners had opposed the race on multiple grounds, including the necessity to conduct it on public roads instead of confining it to the racing circuit at Irungattukottai, and the need to spend \u20b942 crore of public money for the race to be conducted by a private body.Opposing the PIL petitions, the A-G told the court that it was a prestigious event aimed at popularising the sport. Conduct of such a race would prevent youngsters from going astray and, instead, channelise their talents towards competing in such races in the years to come, he said.He added that public money would be spent on laying a world class tarmac on Flag Staff Road, a part of Kamarajar Road, Sivanandam Salai and a section of Anna Salai and it would be a permanent infrastructure that would be available to the motorists even after the race.The A-G also said the cases had been filed with a political motive and that the litigants could not interfere with the policy of the government to popularise a sport. Besides, almost all sporting activities were conducted by private organisations but supported by the government.

In 2022, the count went up to 4,906 cases. Sexual crimes against girls have increased to 5,026 cases, according to the data.

And in 2019, a department was created under the leadership of the Additional DGP; district superintendents were appointed and all-women police stations were also attached.

The book will be released underwater by Aneesha Benedict, marine biologist and coordinator, Friends of Marine Life, at 8 a.m. by handing over a copy to scuba diving students Rizwana Rafeeq, Gayatri Gopan and Avani Balu. Published by Thrissur-based Samatha, the book is about the coral wealth in the world\u2019s oceans and the need for their conservation. The target audience is mainly children, but adults too would find it interesting, says Mr. Aloysius, who hails from Kollam.

Corals are rare along the Kerala coast, but some studies have been conducted off Thiruvananthapuram where they exist,\u201d Mr. Aloysius says.The book also has small chapters on scuba diving and marine coral reef aquariums. Mr. Aloysius, who holds a Master of Fisheries Science (MFSc) degree from the ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai, has worked with aquariums in India, Singapore and Dubai. After the underwater release of the book, a function will be held on Kovalam beach where B.

ALSO READ SC upholds abrogation of Article 370, says move was part of 70-year-old exercise to integrate J&K to the Union Crisis began in Jammu and Kashmir when Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti resigned on June 19, 2018 after the Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support. The Governor, the very next day, had issued a Proclamation under Section 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, which entrusted him with the powers and functions of the State government \u201cin the event of a failure of the constitutional machinery in the State\u201d.

Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya took umbrage to Mr. Pathak\u2019s comments, saying that the government respects the federal structure and funds are withheld only when the States do not follow the laid down guidelines. The Opposition at this stage, walked out, claiming that this a story repeated for every Opposition-ruled State.

About one-third of risk is related to natural hazards \u2013 earthquakes and landslides not linked to climate-change events \u2013 the rest is the risk from the threat of climate change and varies widely across regions,\u201d said Mr. Prothi, who was at Dubai to attend COP28. \u201cSea-level rise and risk from cyclones [which are climate-linked] are 80-90% of the risk weathered by smaller economies.

The CDRI also funds technical-assistance projects, such as developing an early-warning system for cyclones, in a bunch of island nations. \u201cWe\u2019ve given the Dominican Republic a grant to develop an early warning system for multiple hazards,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are looking at how institutions like the India Meteorological Department, the Indian Space Research Organisation, Europe\u2019s Copernicus programme [for earth observation] \u2013 we can\u2019t be entirely India-focused \u2013 can be used to provide technical assistance to places where they aren\u2019t available.\u201dGoing ahead, the CDRI can analyse and recommend projects that can avail of grants from the L&D fund. \u201cFor instance, we can give technical assistance to member countries on planning for heat and floods as part of such projects,\u201d said Mr. Prothi. In India, projects are under way with the power sector in Odisha and telecommunications sector in five States. A study was on to determine the extent to which national budgets of Nepal and Fiji were exposed to climate risk. The CDRI has a \u20b9480-crore fund from the Indian government and commitments worth \u20b9300 crore had been received from other governments,\u201d said Mr. Prothi.Adaptation and L&D are major components of the ongoing discussions in Dubai, where countries must set targets and dedicate vast sums of money to adapt to the challenges already under way, from the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate.
