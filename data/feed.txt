Maharashtra Speaker’s decision conflicts with SC ruling on factions

#### Summary of Maharashtra Speaker's Decision and SC Ruling on Factions

The Maharashtra Speaker's decision regarding the "real" Shiv Sena party conflicts with a Supreme Court judgment. The Speaker based their decision on the "legislative majority" held by the faction led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, claiming that they were the "real" Shiv Sena. However, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, directed in a May 2023 judgment that the Speaker must not base their decision solely on which group possesses a majority in the Legislative Assembly. The court emphasized that the determination of the real party goes beyond numbers and includes the structure of leadership outside the legislative assembly. The court also clarified that the strength in numbers of a faction is irrelevant if the legislators are found guilty of defection by splitting the party, and they would be disqualified under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution. The Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003 deleted the provision of 'split' in Paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule, making the defense of a split no longer available to members facing disqualification proceedings [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra-speakers-decision-conflicts-with-sc-ruling-on-factions/article67741107.ece).

The Supreme Court had set a deadline for the Maharashtra Speaker to decide on disqualification pleas related to the split in the NCP by January 31, 2024, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the Tenth Schedule. The court had also questioned the Speaker's delay in adjudicating the disqualification petitions and urged the Speaker to fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner [[3]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-sets-deadline-for-maharashtra-assembly-speaker-to-decide-on-disqualification-petitions/article67475881.ece) [[6]](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-disqualification-pleas-rahul-narwekar-eknath-shinde-mlas-supreme-court-101698651340396.html) [[7]](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sc-sets-december-31-deadline-for-maharashtra-speaker-to-decide-on-disqualification-pleas-against-shinde-faction-9005866/).

Last batch of Mizoram Bru refugees permanently settled in Tripura

The Tripura government has allocated land for the rehabilitation of the last batch of Mizoram Bru refugees, who were granted permanent settlement in Tripura through a Home Ministry-initiated quadripartite agreement signed on January 16, 2020. The agreement aimed to permanently settle a total of 6,959 Bru tribe families comprising 37,136 persons in 12 different locations across four districts in Tripura.

The settlement process has now been completed with the identification and allocation of land for the final group of refugees. The 12th settlement colony has been established in Laugangsom, located in the Santirbazar subdivision in south Tripura district. This colony will accommodate 633 Bru families and will be spread over an area of 30 hectares that was previously unused. Basic amenities such as electricity, drinking water, and other civic facilities are currently being provided at the site.

In addition to land allocation, the refugees are receiving monthly rations, household items, and a stipend as per the quadripartite agreement signed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the governments of Tripura and Mizoram with the representatives of the Bru refugees.
