The Maharashtra Speaker's decision regarding the ""real"" Shiv Sena party conflicts with a Supreme Court judgment. The Speaker based their decision on the ""legislative majority"" held by the faction led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, claiming that they were the ""real"" Shiv Sena. However, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, directed in a May 2023 judgment that the Speaker must not base their decision solely on which group possesses a majority in the Legislative Assembly. The court emphasized that the determination of the real party goes beyond numbers and includes the structure of leadership outside the legislative assembly. The court also clarified that the strength in numbers of a faction is irrelevant if the legislators are found guilty of defection by splitting the party, and they would be disqualified under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution. The Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003 deleted the provision of 'split' in Paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule, making the defense of a split no longer available to members facing disqualification proceedings [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra-speakers-decision-conflicts-with-sc-ruling-on-factions/article67741107.ece).

The controversy revolves around the company affairs of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's daughter, T. Veena, and her now defunct IT consultancy firm. The Congress and BJP have attempted to portray the monthly payments received by Veena's firm from a Kochi-based mining company as an example of profiting from proximity to power The high-profile inquiry into the matter originated from an Income Tax tribunal decision that the mining firm could not legitimately claim an input tax credit for various payments, including those made to Veena's firm and politicians from different parties The CPI(M) criticized the tribunal's conclusion that Veena's firm had provided no tangible IT services to the mining company without notifying or hearing her [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-counters-nepotism-charges-by-bjp-cong/article67741390.ece).

M.V. Govindan, the State secretary of CPI(M), has refuted claims of a personality cult surrounding Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan within the government and the party. He accused the right-wing corporate media of perpetuating this falsehood to influence public opinion against the government and the party. Govindan highlighted that the media misinterpreted Jnanpith laureate M.T. Vasudevan Nair's speech at the Kerala Literary Festival, where Nair actually spoke against strongmen rule, centralization of authority, and personality cults, without targeting any specific individual. Govindan emphasized that the media's misrepresentation reflects a deep-seated animosity towards the proletarian working-class politics pursued by the CPI(M) [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-disavows-personality-cult-politics-and-says-mts-speech-was-not-targetted-at-cm/article67741452.ece).

He clarified that M.T. Vasudevan Nair's speech merely reiterated a caution against democracies backsliding into autocracies via the ballot, without specifically targeting Kerala. Govindan attributed the misinterpretation of Nair's speech to the fear of bourgeois and capitalist forces towards the proletariat, with journalists being portrayed as instruments of their employers.

D. Ramu, an Army Naik, was married to Anuradha and received pension until his death in April 2010. After his death, a petition was received from D. Padma claiming to be his widow and seeking family pension. It was revealed that Ramu had married Padma in 2003, years after Anuradha allegedly deserted him, without divorcing Anuradha. The situation was further complicated when Ramu's sister posed as his first wife, Anuradha, during his discharge from service. This led to a lengthy legal battle, culminating in a decision by the Armed Forces Tribunal to recognize Padma's claim for pension due to her sustained cohabitation with Ramu, despite the marriage being void. However, the tribunal restricted the pension arrears to three years prior to the date of the original application.

The case involved complex legal and personal issues, ultimately resulting in a decision to grant pension to Padma based on her sustained cohabitation with Ramu, despite the void marriage. The tribunal's decision was in line with principles laid down by the Supreme Court, but the pension arrears were restricted to three years prior to the date of the original application.

The Ganga Sagar Mela, an annual religious congregation held on Sagar Island in West Bengal, is facing challenges due to rising sea levels and erosion of the beach in front of the Kapil Muni temple. The West Bengal government is seeking 'National Fair' status for the event, but the erosion has become an eyesore. The administration has put up warning signs and diverted pilgrims to other beaches on the island for the holy dip. The government has installed tetrapods to arrest erosion, but the impact will only be known after the monsoon. The construction on the island has violated coastal regulation zones, and experts attribute the erosion to human interventions and the lack of sediment influx from the Ganga Meghna Brahmaputra river system. The rising sea level has also brought the water closer to the Kapil Muni temple, and earlier temples of Kapil Muni have gone under the sea. The West Bengal government has spent about \u20b925 crore for dredging the Sagar Island, which is about 10% of the estimated budget of the Ganga Sagar Mela."

A group of 11 women police officers from the Maharashtra police have been deployed at a critical outpost in the Gadchiroli district of India. These women, informally called commandos, have undergone intensive training in jungle warfare and weaponry. They are positioned at a strategic intersection along the Red Corridor, directly facing the Maoist headquarters in the Dandakaranya forest. The outpost, protected by a 10-feet compound wall and MAC barriers, plays a vital role in launching anti-guerrilla operations and curbing the movement of insurgents. The women commandos are part of a 200-strong security force and are determined to flush out the insurgents from the region. The outpost is the first of its kind to be established before becoming stable, and it is expected to bring significant transformation to the lives of the people in the surrounding villages. The deployment of women officers at this outpost is seen as a groundbreaking move in the left-wing extremism (LWE) area of India [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/breaking-ground-women-commandos-take-on-maoist-stronghold/article67740633.ece) [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite\u2013Maoist_insurgency).

#### Women Commandos in Maoist Stronghold:
The women commandos stationed at the outpost in the Gadchiroli district are part of a 200-strong security force. They have undergone intensive training in jungle warfare and weaponry and are informally called commandos. These women are familiar with the treacherous terrain and intricacies of the local language, making them well-equipped to flush out the insurgents from the region. They are passionate about their job and are proud to be part of the elite and historic team. Despite facing challenges and potential danger, they remain vigilant and committed to their duty [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/breaking-ground-women-commandos-take-on-maoist-stronghold/article67740633.ece).

#### Strategic Role of the Outpost:
The outpost in Gadchiroli district plays a strategic role in launching anti-guerrilla operations and quelling the movement of insurgents. It is positioned at the gateway to the Maoist headquarters, which strikes fear into the Maoists as it plugs their transit route to the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. Before the establishment of this outpost, there was a significant security vacuum on the border, as the area was completely under Maoist control. The outpost is protected by a 10-feet compound wall, MAC barriers, and other security measures. It is the first time women officers have been deployed before an outpost became stable, highlighting their key role in this groundbreaking initiative [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/breaking-ground-women-commandos-take-on-maoist-stronghold/article67740633.ece).

#### Challenges and Security Measures:
The outpost in the Gadchiroli district is susceptible to attacks due to the historical dominance of Maoists in the area. The security forces stationed there have to remain vigilant at all times and leave no security lapse, as any lapse could prove fatal. To enhance security, the outpost has implemented Defencell MAC barriers, a system used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq to protect their compounds. With a 10-feet compound wall and MAC barriers, the outpost has two-layer solid protection. The implementation of these security measures aims to ensure the safety of the commandos and the success of their mission [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/breaking-ground-women-commandos-take-on-maoist-stronghold/article67740633.ece).

#### Impact on the Region:
The establishment of the outpost in the Gadchiroli district has brought significant transformation to the lives of over 5,000 people in the 13 surrounding villages. The presence of the outpost and its commandos has provided security and stability to the region. Development initiatives, such as the construction of roads and cell towers, are underway, further improving the lives of the local population. The outpost has also brought civil administration to an area that was previously known as the ""Liberated Zone."" The pioneering team of women commandos has played a crucial role in this transformation [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/breaking-ground-women-commandos-take-on-maoist-stronghold/article67740633.ece).

#### Conclusion:
The deployment of women commandos at the critical outpost in the Gadchiroli district is a groundbreaking move in the fight against left-wing extremism in India. These highly trained officers are positioned strategically to combat Maoist insurgents and disrupt their activities in the region. The outpost plays a vital role in launching anti-guerrilla operations and bringing stability and development to the surrounding villages. The women commandos, along with the security forces, are determined to ensure the safety and well-being of the local population and flush out the insurgents from the area [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/breaking-ground-women-commandos-take-on-maoist-stronghold/article67740633.ece)"

One specific forest patch in the Ulandy range, which previously had large areas of bamboo, is also being restored. After a forest fire in 2015, invasive species such as Lantana camara and Eupatorium took over the fertile ground. The Forest Department engaged people from the ATR's tribal settlements to remove the invasive plants and plant saplings of native trees, including Aegle marmelos (Vilvam), Syzygium cumini (Jamun), Pterocarpus marsupium (Vengai), and bamboo seedlings [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/saplings-of-native-trees-replace-invasive-species-in-anamalai-tiger-reserves-core-areas/article67740719.ece).

In total, 9,000 saplings have been planted on 90 hectares of forest lands in the Ulandy range so far. The government aims to restore 33,290 hectares of degraded forest lands in Tamil Nadu within five years through this project, for which NABARD has provided a loan of \u20b9457 crore.

In the case of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve, the Forest Department's efforts to remove invasive species and restore native trees contribute to the conservation and restoration of the reserve's biodiversity and habitat [[3]](https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species).

Overall, the Forest Department's mass removal of invasive species and the subsequent planting of native tree saplings in the Ulandy range of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve is part of a larger project aimed at restoring degraded forest lands in Tamil Nadu. This initiative not only helps combat the threat of invasive species but also contributes to the conservation of native wildlife and the enhancement of green cover in the region [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/saplings-of-native-trees-replace-invasive-species-in-anamalai-tiger-reserves-core-areas/article67740719.ece) [[2]](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/native-species-planting-in-ulandy-to-restore-reserve-forest/articleshow/106849674.cms)."

Sathyarthi mentioned that his ideas, such as the eradication of child labor and bonded labor, have been included in the revised Sustainable Development Goals. He encouraged people to channelize their anger towards injustice and fight against it. The 7th edition of the Kerala Literature Festival concluded with the participation of over five lakh people and announced that the eighth edition would be held from January 9 to 12, 2025.

Kailash Sathyarthi, a Nobel laureate and children's rights activist, has been working against child labor and child trafficking for decades. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for his struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Sathyarthi's mission as a children's rights activist began when he witnessed a child working as a shoeshine boy instead of attending school. This incident deeply affected him and motivated him to take action against child labor and exploitation [[6]](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2014/satyarthi/facts/).

In his address at the Kerala Literature Festival, Sathyarthi emphasized the need for global compassion and action against child labor and injustice.

Enforcement agencies in Telangana, India, have recently conducted raids to uncover the business of spurious drugs. The Drugs Control Administration (DCA) has targeted 10 facilities, resulting in the confiscation of nearly 1,171 kg of counterfeit medications worth \u20b99.76 crore. Spurious drugs, also known as counterfeit drugs, are deceitfully manufactured medicines designed to mimic reputable products. These fraudulent medications can have severe health implications and may even bear the details of non-existent manufacturers. Medical experts warn that the consumption of such illicit drugs poses a significant health risk, as they fail to address medical conditions and can lead to disastrous consequences over time. The recent raids have revealed a disturbing trend, with fake medicines falsely labeled under the names of reputable companies [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-fighting-surge-in-spurious-drug-trade-doctors-sound-alarm/article67740688.ece).

#### Impact on Trust and Health:
Kiran Madala, the Scientific Committee convenor of the Indian Medical Association-Telangana State, highlights the potential impact of spurious drugs on trust in medicines, healthcare providers, and health systems. Lookalike drugs may appear genuine until closely examined, revealing poor standards that can harm one's health upon inspection. The prolonged consumption of counterfeit drugs can have serious implications for vital organs like the kidneys and liver, potentially leading to fatal outcomes due to impurities present in illicit substances. Substandard medicines may not have an immediate negative impact, but the unpredictable nature of fake drugs, where consumers are unaware of the actual content, poses a significant health risk.

#### Loopholes in Drug Monitoring Standards:
There is a critical loophole in the drug monitoring system at the state level. While the preparation of a new drug requires approval from the Central government, state drug control bodies are often understaffed and lack a robust monitoring system. This provides an entry point for companies to introduce spurious drugs into the market without proper scrutiny. The recent raids by the DCA officials have exposed the presence of fake medicines falsely labeled under the names of reputable companies such as Sun Pharma, Glenmark Pharma, Aristo Pharmaceuticals, and Torrent Pharma [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-fighting-surge-in-spurious-drug-trade-doctors-sound-alarm/article67740688.ece).

In conclusion, the recent raids conducted by the Drugs Control Administration in Telangana have uncovered the business of spurious drugs. These counterfeit medications pose a severe threat to health and can have disastrous consequences for patients. Medical experts emphasize the need for stricter monitoring and regulation to combat the proliferation of spurious drugs and protect public health"

Pasha further explained India's contribution to the Turkish liberation movement and the convergence of intentions between the people of both countries after World War I. He also mentioned the support of the Indian Khilafat movement for the Turkish liberation movement. The session was moderated by the Turkish Ambassador to India, Firat Sunel."

The DMK has launched a scathing attack on the consecration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya, alleging that the BJP government at the Centre had made a gimmick of consecrating an incomplete temple in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha election. DMK Parliamentary Party leader T.R. Baalu criticized the BJP government for using the consecration of the Ram temple as a political gimmick ahead of elections. He stated that the BJP government, after ""hunting down the people of the country in every way in the last ten years,"" was now claiming that it had completed the construction of the Ram temple [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-consecration-of-ram-temple-is-a-political-gimmick/article67741644.ece).

Baalu emphasized that faith in God is an individual's spiritual quest and right, and using bhakti as a capital for political mobilization and vote-bank politics is against the soul of India and values of the Constitution. He further stated that capitalizing on individuals' faith and right was against democratic norms and spiritual values. Baalu also criticized the BJP government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for seeking to deceive the people by highlighting the construction and consecration of a temple as an achievement. He expressed that the people of India will reject the BJP government's attempt to convert a spiritual festival into a political festival.

Moreover, Baalu condemned the BJP for using a temple festival for laying the stone for its 'Mother rashtra' and accused the party of continuing its efforts to destroy India's character of unity in diversity. He stated that instead of doing good for the people, the party tries to win through means of deceit. Baalu also highlighted the DMK's commitment to secularism and its dedication to harmonious politics filled with fraternalism. He mentioned that the DMK never took advantage of the ideas of linking politics with bhakti and spiritualism. Additionally, he pointed out that the DMK government led by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had renovated and performed 'kumbabishekam' for thousands of temples and reclaimed temple properties to the tune of \u20b95,381 crore but never spoke about them on election platforms for the sake of vote bank politics [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-consecration-of-ram-temple-is-a-political-gimmick/article67741644.ece).

In conclusion, the DMK's criticism of the consecration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya revolves around the accusation of the BJP government using it as a political gimmick ahead of elections and capitalizing on individuals' faith for political gains, which the DMK views as against the democratic norms and spiritual values of India [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-consecration-of-ram-temple-is-a-political-gimmick/article67741644.ece).

A colloquium titled ""Palestine: Endless Occupation, Permanent Crisis"" was held at the Asian College of Journalism in Chennai. The event focused on the geopolitical implications of the Israel-Hamas war. The speakers discussed various aspects of the conflict, including the challenges to the ""Two-state solution"" and the role of different countries and international organizations.

Former Indian diplomat Rakesh Sood highlighted how the idea of a Two-state solution has been undermined by right-wing governments in Israel over the past 25 years, with little intervention from the international community [[1]](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/colloquium-discusses-geopolitical-implications-of-israel-hamas-war/article67740453.ece). Professor P.R.
